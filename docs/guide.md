# Guide

Setting up this bot is quite simple. Firstly, make sure you have [invited the bot](https://membercount.net/invite?from=docs-guide) to your server with the correct permissions (administrator, or see the [faq](faq)).

### Step 1
Use `m!setup`. This is actually all you need to do. Running this command will add the following to the bottom of your channel list:

You can move this category and the counters anywhere. You are also free to rename the category to whatever you wish, or even delete it.
Note that, due to you following along with this guide likely being the owner of your server, there are no locks displayed.
To members that don't have the administrator permission, they will display like this:

### Step 2
It's common that you may not want or need all the counters displayed by default. You can turn them off with `m!counter <counter> <on | off>`.
Please carefully read the documentation for this command [here](commands?id=counter).
